# T.P 2

The goal of this assignment was to develop two programs.

One which could validate a string composed of octal, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers, separated by a '$'.

And another, given a string composed of decimal numbers and the 4 essential operators, should calculate and return the result.

You can read the full assignment [here](./assignment.md).

## Automata

To validate the strings the following automata were used:

-   [first exercise](./assets/automata_1.png)
-   [third exercise](./assets/automata_2.png)

The failure states were ignored in the graphics because it became a real mess. :)

### Disclaimer

The aut√≥matas were drawn using [graphviz](http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/).

## Run the programs

If you wish to run the programs, you can do it by executing the makefile:

1. ex_1: `make 1 arg=<STRING_TO_VALIDATE>`
2. ex_2: `make 2 arg=<STRING_TO_CALCULATE>`
